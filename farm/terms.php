    <h2>Booking Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>

    <p><strong>Welcome. </strong>Thank you for choosing to book with Reddivallen. We look forward to welcoming you.
        Please be aware that when making a reservation you are entering a contract with us. The terms and conditions are
        set out below:</p>

    <p><strong>Cancellation and Insurance.</strong> A contract is made between us once we have received your deposit.
        The first night of your stay is charged as a deposit. For your security we prefer this to be
        paid by phone, using either a debit/credit card. From that time any deposit you have paid is non-refundable.</p>

    <p>If you need to cancel please contact us immediately. For cancellations made up to 21 days before your date of
        arrival, the deposit will be retained but can be used against a future booking taken within 6 months of the
        cancellation. For cancellations made after this time, or by failing to take up the booking without cancelling,
        you will be liable for the total amount. For this reason we strongly recommend that you take out cancellation
        insurance, which is inexpensive and can be obtained from any good broker.</p>

    <p><strong>Check in. </strong>Your accommodation is available from 4.00 pm on the day of arrival. We would
        appreciate it if you could phone or email on the morning of your arrival to give us some idea of your arrival
        time so that there is someone to welcome you. We serve tea and home made cakes on your arrival. </p>

    <p><strong>Check out. </strong>We ask that you please vacate your room by 11.00 am.</p>

    <p><strong>Damages and Breakages. </strong>Please take care of the premises. You are responsible and liable for any
        breakages or damages which you cause to the accommodation or its contents. Please report as soon as they occur
        especially if you accidentally spill something &ndash; it&rsquo;s much easier to clean if we know what it is and
        act quickly. We do not normally charge for breakages, but we reserve the right to charge for repair or making
        good if the damage is significant.</p>

    <p><strong>Data. </strong>Some of the data gathered during the course of this booking may be held on computer. We
        would like to hold this data after your visit to be able to inform you of future offers. If you would prefer us
        not to hold this information please let us know.</p>

        or any vehicles or possessions, unless proven to be caused by a negligent act by hosts or employees
        whilst acting in the course of their employment. </p>

    <p><strong>Non-Availability. </strong>We would only cancel your booking if your accommodation was unavailable for
        reasons beyond our control. We would attempt to find you alternative accommodation, however if this is not
        possible, or unacceptable to you, then we would refund all monies paid by you. Tlhe iability will not extend
        beyond this refund.<br />

        the preferred choice of room.</p>

        telephone, drinks etc are additional with the exception of tea and coffee trays and your complimentary tea and
